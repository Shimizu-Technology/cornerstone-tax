# Database Rules

## General
- **Development**: Local PostgreSQL (`cornerstone_development`)
- **Production**: PostgreSQL on Neon (via DATABASE_URL)
- Rails manages all migrations
- FastAPI mirrors schema with SQLAlchemy (no migrations)
- Both environments share the same schema

## Naming Conventions
- Tables: plural, snake_case (`tax_returns`, `workflow_stages`)
- Columns: snake_case (`first_name`, `created_at`)
- Foreign keys: `{singular_table}_id` (`client_id`)
- Indexes: Rails default naming is fine

## Required Columns
Every table should have:
- `id` (primary key, auto-increment)
- `created_at` (timestamp)
- `updated_at` (timestamp)

## Configurable Tables
These tables allow admin customization without code changes:

### workflow_stages
- Stores configurable workflow statuses
- `position` determines order
- `notify_client` flag triggers notifications
- `is_active` for soft delete
- Default stages seeded on setup

### time_categories
- Stores configurable time tracking categories
- `is_active` for soft delete
- Default categories seeded on setup

## Relationships
- `clients` → has many `dependents`
- `clients` → has many `tax_returns`
- `tax_returns` → belongs to `workflow_stage`
- `tax_returns` → has many `documents`
- `tax_returns` → has many `workflow_events` (audit trail)
- `tax_returns` → has many `income_sources`
- `users` → has many `time_entries`
- `time_entries` → belongs to `time_category`

## Security
- Encrypt sensitive data: bank account numbers, SSN (if stored)
- Use Rails encrypted attributes or application-level encryption
- Never store plain text passwords (Clerk handles auth)

## Indexes
Always add indexes for:
- Foreign keys
- Columns used in WHERE clauses
- Columns used for sorting

## Soft Delete Pattern
Use `is_active` boolean instead of deleting records:
- Preserves historical data
- Audit trail remains intact
- Filter with `where(is_active: true)` by default
