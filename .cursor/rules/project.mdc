# Cornerstone Accounting Project

## What This Project Is
A unified digital platform for Cornerstone Accounting & Business Services (Guam):
- Public website (marketing, services, contact)
- Digital client intake form (online + iPad kiosk mode)
- Admin dashboard for workflow tracking, time tracking, and audit trail
- AI-powered transmittal generator (future phase)

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Main Backend**: Ruby on Rails (API mode)
- **AI Backend**: Python + FastAPI (for transmittal AI, shares same database)
- **Database**: 
  - Development: Local PostgreSQL
  - Production: PostgreSQL on Neon (shared between Rails and FastAPI)
- **Auth**: Clerk
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 (private, pre-signed URLs)
- **Email**: Resend
- **SMS**: ClickSend
- **Hosting**: Netlify (frontend), Render (backend services)

## Guiding Principles (ALWAYS FOLLOW)

### 1. Mobile-First, Responsive Always
- Every feature must work on mobile AND desktop from day one
- Minimum 44x44px touch targets (48px for primary actions)
- Test on real devices, not just browser resize
- Mobile is NOT a "Phase 2" thing

### 2. Ease of Use Over Feature Richness
- If users need instructions, we've failed
- Reduce clicks, reduce friction, reduce cognitive load
- Design for the least technical user

### 3. Do It Right, Not Quick
- Prefer proper solutions over bandaid fixes
- Build for the long run, not just "make it work now"
- Good architecture upfront > technical debt later

### 4. Configurability Over Hardcoding
- Workflow stages are admin-configurable (stored in database)
- Time tracking categories are admin-configurable
- Avoid hardcoding values that might change

## User Roles
- **Admin**: Full access, user management, settings
- **Employee**: Workflow management, time tracking, assigned returns
- **Client**: View own return status, upload documents (future)

## Key Domain Concepts
- **Client**: Person who submits intake form for tax preparation
- **Tax Return**: The workflow item being tracked through stages
- **Workflow Stage**: Configurable status (intake_received → complete)
- **Workflow Event**: Audit log entry (who did what, when)
- **Time Entry**: Employee hours logged against categories
- **Transmittal**: Document sent with tax return materials
